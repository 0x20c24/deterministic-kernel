deterministic-kernel
====================

Deterministic kernel build scripts, for Linux, mainly for Debian for now.

See also:
https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuildsKernel

Currently working:
mostly same *content* when you unpack the .deb and then unpack the .gz (and skip symlinks!) 
calculated the sha sums there.

Under some conditions - try same user name/path, maybe host - see the Wiki.
